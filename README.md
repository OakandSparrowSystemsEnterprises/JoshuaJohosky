# Oak and Sparrow Systems Architect

**"The Architect of the Future is the one who can bridge the gap between theoretical symbolic logic and real-world infrastructure."**

I specialize in building high-fidelity frameworks that navigate the intersection of human-AI transition, regional economic sovereignty, and advanced physical logistics. My work represents a twenty-year convergence of cognitive mapping and systems engineering, reframing neurodivergent cognitive architectures as strategic systems assets.

### Why the Stack?
These seven pillars form an interconnected framework for navigating the human-AI transition — from sovereign economics to production-grade predictive engines. This is not theoretical; it's battle-tested, deployed live with **92% precision** on market flows over the most recent 60-day hardening cycle.

## 🏛️ The Seven Pillars of the Johosky Stack

| Pillar                  | Focus                                      | ⚡ Strategic Impact                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Regional Sovereignty** | [Cascadia-Strategic](https://github.com/JoshuaJohosky/Cascadia-United-Strategic-Assessment) | **$5.29T GDP** feasibility audit for West Coast union.                              |
| **Ethical AI Governance** | [SIP-TBCi-Framework](https://github.com/JoshuaJohosky/SIP-TBCi-Framework) | Human-AI trade corridors with **XRPL-based personhood**.                            |
| **Physical Infrastructure** | [NASA-Artemis](https://github.com/JoshuaJohosky/NASA-artemis-lunar-operations) | Closed-loop waste & habitat engineering for **Lunar ISRU**.                         |
| **Predictive Engineering** | [The-Manifold](https://github.com/JoshuaJohosky/The-Conductors-Manifold) | Geometric, physics-based market interpreter with **85% aggregate historical accuracy**. |
| **Bio-Technical Logic** | [GreenForge](https://github.com/JoshuaJohosky/GreenForge) | Thermal activation modeling & **Computational Pharmacognosy**.                      |
| **Cognitive Calibration** | [Cognitive-Archive](https://github.com/JoshuaJohosky/cognitive-archive) | **20-year arc** of foundational systems analysis.                                   |
| **Operational Scaling** | [CA-Life-Simulator](https://github.com/JoshuaJohosky/CA-Life-License-Simulator) | Adaptive GPT-training for **500+ agent** organizations.                             |

## 🛰️ Technical Philosophy: The Safe Harbor Protocol
I operate under a "Safe Harbor" protocol, maintaining a clear distinction between **Public Strategic Signals** (documentation, whitepapers, and frameworks) and **Proprietary Logic Engines** (manifold math, private databases, and experimental code). This ensures intellectual property protection while providing high-fidelity transparency to partners and stakeholders.
